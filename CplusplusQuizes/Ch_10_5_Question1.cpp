// Quiz time
// Write function prototypes for each of the following functions.
// Use the most appropriate parameter and return types (by value, by address, or by reference), including use of const where appropriate.

//1) A function named sumTo() that takes an integer parameter and returns the sum of all the numbers between 1 and the input number.

//int sumTo(int value);

//2) A function named printEmployeeName() that takes an Employee struct as input.

//void printEmployeeName(const Employee& employee);

// 3) A function named minmax() that takes two integers as input and returns back to the caller the smaller and larger number in a std::pair. 
// A std::pair works identical to a std::tuple but stores exactly two elements.

//std::pair<int, int> minmax(int value1, int value2);

//) A function named getIndexOfLargestValue() that takes an integer array (as a std::vector), and returns the index of the largest element in the array.

//std::size_t getIndexOfLargestValue(const std::vector<int>& array);

// 5) A function named getElement() that takes an array of std::string (as a std::vector) and an index and returns the array element at that index (not a copy).
//  Assume the index is valid, and the return value is const.

//const std::string getElement(const std::vector<string>& array);
