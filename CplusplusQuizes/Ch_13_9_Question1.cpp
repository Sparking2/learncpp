//Question #1
//
//A map is a class that stores elements as a key - value pair.
//The key must be unique, and is used to access the associated pair.
//In this quiz, we�re going to write an application that lets us assign grades to students by name, using a simple map class.
//The student�s name will be the key, and the grade(as a char) will be the value.
//a) First, write a struct named StudentGrade that contains the student�s name(as a std::string) and grade(as a char).
//b) Add a class named GradeMap that contains a std::vector of StudentGrade named m_map.
//c) Write an overloaded operator[] for this class.
//This function should take a std::string parameter, and return a reference to a char.
//In the body of the function, first see if the student�s name already exists(You can use std::find_if from <algorithm>).
//If the student exists, return a reference to the grade and you�re done.
//Otherwise, use the std::vector::push_back() function to add a StudentGrade for this new student.
//When you do this, std::vector will add a copy of your StudentGrade to itself
//(resizing if needed, invalidating all previously returned references).Finally,
//we need to return a reference to the grade for the student we just added to the std::vector.
//We can access the student we just added using the std::vector::back() function.
